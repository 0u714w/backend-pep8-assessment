# Assessment: PEP 8
For this assessment, you'll be cleaning up a program that functions propely,
but doesn't conform to the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
style guide. 

Your task is to update the program so that it is PEP 8 compliant. 

## Guidelines

- You should *not* remove comments. If a comment is two long,  for instance,
  simply break it up into multiple lines.

- While there are several other PEP 8 violations, we are only concerned with
  those reported by [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
